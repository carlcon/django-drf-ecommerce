This source code was developed by following a tutorial on YouTube for the explicit purpose of gaining more experience on Django Web Framework fundamentals. It is intended solely for educational use and serves as a practical demonstration of the concepts covered in the tutorial.

- Setup and initiate new Django and Django DRF application
- Design, Implement and iterate over a database schema (Product, Category, Brand Models)
- Implement Routers Viewsets and Serializers to create API endpoints for client interactions
- Implement serializer customizations to customize data output
- Build unit and end-to-end tests to ensure the application works as intended (pytest-factoryboy)
- Document the API endpoints to support frontend interactions (drf-spectacular)
